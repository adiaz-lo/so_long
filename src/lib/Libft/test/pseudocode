This program will locate the first occurrence of the null-terminated given substring in a given string where not more than a given characters are searched. Characters that appear after a '\0' are not searched.

While substring is not NULL & string is not NULL & length is not NULL
	

char	*ft_substr(char const *s, uint start, size_t len);

const size_t sl = ft_strlen(s);
